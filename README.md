# Ethers Simple Storage FCC / Patrick

## What we have learned:

-   Creat a new project with node-js
-   Add diffreent dependencies of external packages into our local packages, like:

    -   `@types/fs-extra`
    -   `dotenv`
    -   `ethers`
    -   `solc` and more...

-   Basic setup of our javascript scripts like importing packages.
    We used `async` keywords so our functions can use asynchronous programing and get access the `await` keywords.

-   Connect to blockchains using `RPC_URL`.
-   Ethers package to interact with the blockchain in javascript.
-   Encrypt our private key.
-   Get the ABI & the Bianry of our code to deploy to blockchain.
-   Deploy and interact with contracts programmatically.

### Vcode Extensions:

-   Solidity and Hardhat
-   Prettier - Code formatter

#### Tools:

**Testnet:** Goerli

**Note:** Typescript is used over Javascript, because in the course, we've learnd both.
